# CMake configuration file build the Biometric Evaluation Framework and test
# programs. The programs are linked to the shared library built by this
# configuration.
#
# To use CMake:
# Create a build directory; in this example, it is located under the common
# directory, but could be located anywhere:
#     mkdir build; cd build
#     cmake ..
#     make
#
# NOTE: A parallel build (make -j) may fail due to the fact that the test
# programs need to build after the library, but parallel invocation may
# attempt to compile test programs before the library is completely built.
#
# To run a test program:
#     ./bin/test_be_feature_an2kminutiae
#
